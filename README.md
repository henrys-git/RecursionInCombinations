# Hack Hour Strategy - Recursions in Combinations

## Why Recursion for Combinations?
- Recursion is great when you can break the problem down into a smaller version of itself that ultimately reaches a base case, like whittling down a list or possibilities.
- Generating combinations with recursion aligns well with the idea of "taking it" or "leaving it" and recursively calling for each of those cases.

## Challenges
1. Subset Sum
2. All Subsets
3. HT Permutations
4. Partition Number
