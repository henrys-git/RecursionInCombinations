# Hack Hour Strategy - Recursions in Combinations

## Plan
- We will discuss strategies for approaching algorithm challenges and spot when we might want to use recursion in generating combinations
- We will see several challenges and conceptually go over the plan, and then the implementatino of it in code

## Why recursion for combinations?
- Recursion is great when you can break the problem down into a smaller version of itself, that ultimately reaches a base case, like wittling down a list, or possibilities
- Generating combinations with recursion goes very much with the idea of "taking it" or "leaving it" and recursively call for each of those cases

## Challenges
1. subset-sum
2. all-subsets
3. ht-permutations
4. partition-number
