# Hack Hour Strategy - Recursions in Combinations

## Why Recursion for Combinations?
- Recursion is great when you can break the problem down into a smaller version of itself that ultimately reaches a base case, like whittling down a list or possibilities.
- Generating combinations with recursion aligns well with the idea of "taking it" or "leaving it" and recursively calling for each of those cases.

## Combinations vs Permutations

### Combinations
- **Definition**: Selection of items where the order does not matter.
- **Example**: Choosing 2 books to take on vacation from a shelf of an adventure book, a mystery book, and a romance book ([adventure, mystery] is the same as [mystery, adventure]).
- **Use Case**: Generating subsets of a set.
- **Mnemonic**: Combinations => Choice

### Permutations
- **Definition**: Arrangement of items where the order does matter.
- **Example**: Arranging 3 books on a shelf from a collection of an adventure book, a mystery book, and a romance book ([adventure, mystery, romance] is different from [mystery, adventure, romance]).
- **Use Case**: Generating all possible orderings of a set.
- **Mnemonic**: Permutations => Position

## Challenges
1. Subset Sum
2. All Subsets
3. HT Permutations
4. Partition Number
